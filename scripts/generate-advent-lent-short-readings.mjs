// Generates proper-of-seasons short-reading overrides for ordinary Advent and Lent ferial
// days, distinct from the Ordinary Time "complementary psalmody" cycle in data/psalter/week{N}
// - see SOURCES.md, "Cross-check witness: Breviarium" for how this was discovered
// (Advent/Lent Breviarium witnesses disagreed with Ordinary Time ones for the same nominal
// psalter-week/day, and it was specifically the Ordinary Time witness that matched this app's
// existing ferial citations).
//
// Written as bare `hours.<hour>.shortReading` overrides with NO `psalmody` - src/office.ts
// already falls back to the ferial four-week skeleton's psalmody whenever a proper entry
// doesn't supply its own (see resolveDay), so these files change only the short reading, not
// the psalms/canticles.
//
// Single-sourced from Breviarium (no second independent witness the way the ferial cross-check
// had 5-8 corroborating Ordinary Time cycles per slot), so every entry here is
// "verified": false - the same standing as this app's other single-page-sourced short readings
// (see SOURCES.md, "Short Scripture reading assignments").
//
// Deliberately does NOT cover Dec 17-24 (the O Antiphon stretch): the romcal version this app
// depends on gives those days an ordinary week-based celebration key (e.g.
// "wednesdayOfThe4thWeekOfAdvent") that is NOT stable year to year - which week number Dec
// 17-24 falls under shifts depending on where Christmas lands - while Breviarium models these
// eight days as fixed dates independent of week number (its own ids are
// "advent_december_17".."advent_december_24"). Mapping those onto an unstable romcal key would
// silently be wrong in some years, so this is left for a future date-based (not
// celebrationKey-based) resolution mechanism, the same way src/oAntiphon.ts already resolves
// the O Antiphons themselves by date rather than by key.
//
// Also deliberately omits `vespers` on Saturday files: in this app, Advent/Lent Saturdays
// always resolve their Vespers as First Vespers of the following Sunday
// (src/office.ts's saturdayBeginsSunday), which reads the SUNDAY proper's `hours.firstVespers`,
// not the Saturday file's own `hours.vespers` - so a Saturday `vespers` entry here would just
// be dead data never consulted. Sunday's own First Vespers isn't populated either: Breviarium's
// Saturday-keyed entry is Saturday's OWN Vespers, not necessarily the same text as Sunday's
// First Vespers, and conflating the two without a way to verify that risks a wrong assignment -
// left for future work.
